#  4 type integers numbers divided by  Decimal base 10 :  2, -3 , Octal bae 8: 0o25, Hexadecimal base 16 : 0xA12, Binary base 2: 0b0110 , ........ these 4 integer numbers are called number system

# penta number system =base  5 , digit 5: 0,1,2,3,4
# octal number system = base 8, digit 8: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
# quarter number system = 4, digit 4: 0,1,2,3
# binary number system = 2, digit 2: 0,1
#  headecimal number system = base 10, digit 10: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,c,d,e,f we write in both letters
#  century number system = base 100, digit 100 : 0-->99

# we can make too much system but in python or in computer science there are used just 4 integer number system ,.... # IN python we cant write subscript so i use 

# 1)decimal : 3 , -9
# 2)octal : 0o25
# 3) hexadecimal: 0xA12
# 4) binary : 0b0110



# NUMBER SYSTEM IN COMPUTER
#  In computer system we work on 4 number systems:
# IN DECIMAL take value  this vale are used in every number sytem because that is range of decimal 0-->9  we write in rane 9 like 239,

#  IN OCTAL 0-->7  we can write in range 0-->7 like 567 not write obove 7 like 348 8 is not in octal range ,
#  IN HEXADECIMAL 0-->15 or 0-->f if we write 23f = true, 

# IN BINARY 0-->1 ... if i write in biray 231 this is not range in 0-->1

# decimal 100 write as it is = 100
#  octal supercript 8 write = 0o100   0o  Zero o  is 8 subscript we can also use capital O
# Hexadecimal               = 0x100   0x is 16 subscript
#  binary                   = 0b100   0b is 2 subscript
