#  is main user hi add/sum walay digit pehlay se fix nhn hotay ye user define karta hai
print(2+3)

#  ab is program ko interactive bana hai
#  aisay program jis main user involve usko kehtay hain interactive programs

#  2 kida of prgrams
#  1) Rigid program           2)  Intercative programs   
#   not user interaction            user interaction.. 
#                             like patterns  ATM mashin, video players
#    worst                           Better

#  which one is good in both programs interactive program bcz anthything didnt work without user
#  Rigit programs are worst program
#  agar hum ko user se koi baat poochni hai to usko
#  variables/ refrence bhi kehtay hain ye user interactive program hoga
#  variavle is holde or container which store value which make in memory in c/c++, 
# But in python varible means name aik aisa naam jo kisi ko di gaya hai , means meray paas aik value hai usko aik naam de dia hai, yahan kabhi bhi var ka matlab box ya container nhn hai
#  python main reffrence ka kaam hota hai aur reffrence variable ke through banaye jatay hain
#  reffrence/variable are same in python but in c, c++ and java reffrence and variable are diffrent like:
#  int a;
# a = 5
#  if we write code 
# a = 5,76 then error bcz its not int , but in python:
#  a = 5   ye ban gaya isko hu data/litarls value/comst bhi bol saktay hain  python main 5 ka container nhn banta ...just c , c++, aur java main container bantay hain
